# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The dataset used for this project contains historical data on house sales, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and sale price.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in CSV format and contains the following columns:

- `SalePrice`: The sale price of the house (target variable)
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- `YearBuilt`: Original construction date
- `Neighborhood`: Physical location within city limits
- Other relevant features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.

## Data Preprocessing

- **EDA**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, identify outliers, and explore relationships between variables.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and identify and handle outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, transform existing features, and encode categorical variables for model training.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scale numerical features to ensure that all features have the same scale, which can improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.

## Model Development

- **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, etc., to identify the best-performing model for house price prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters for selected models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Model Deployment

- **Export Model**: Once the best-performing model is identified, export the trained model to a file for deployment.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a production environment using frameworks like Flask, Django, or FastAPI to serve predictions.
